## context

when I look at a flower, I do not see just a beautiful object to put in a vase.

I see an intelligent organism that is not still.

Perhaps it just opened its petals to discover light for the first time. Or maybe it is at the end of its period, desperately blossoming to attract a bee and get `pollinated`.

As humans, we `innately` respond to the booming of a flower. But how do we design this exact feeling? How can we capture this `visceral` response in people? I co-founded an artistic practice `to tap the mysteries of this world` not by studying, but by making.
