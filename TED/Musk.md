- Hello. So, in just few minutes, umm, Elon Mask will be joining us here live on stage for a conversation. Rumer has it that there are a few things to talk about with him. We will see, but before that, I just want to show you something spatial. I want you to come with me to Tesla's huge gigafactury in Austin Texas. So the day before it opened lask week, the evening before I was allowed to walk around it. No one else was there, and what I saw there was honestly pretty mind-blowing. This is Elon Musk's famous machine that builds the machine and his view, the secret to a sustainable future. It is not just making an electric car. It is making a system that chums out huge numbers of electric cars with a margin so that they can find further growth. When I was there, none of us knew whether Elon would actually be able to make it here today, so I took the chance to sit down with him and recorded an epic interview and I just want to show you an 8 minutes excerpt of that interview. So, here from Austin Texas, Elon Musk.
