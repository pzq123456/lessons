Here is an IELTS-style response describing someone who enjoys cooking for others:

I'd like to talk about my mother, Alice, who loves cooking for our family and friends. My mom has always enjoyed being in the kitchen. She finds it relaxing and takes pride in creating delicious homemade meals.  

Over the years, my mom has perfected recipes for many of our favorite dishes like lasagna, steak sandwiches, and her special chocolate chip cookies. She enjoys browsing cookbooks and cooking websites to get new recipe ideas as well. My mom will cook just about anything, but prefers making hearty Italian meals, savory pies, and fancy desserts.

My mom most enjoys cooking for my dad, siblings, and me on a daily basis. She makes sure we have sit-down dinners together when possible. For birthdays and holidays, my mom will spend all day cooking up a big feast to celebrate together. She also loves hosting dinner parties and potlucks for her friends from church or the neighborhood. 

I think my mother enjoys cooking for others because it allows her to show care and express her creativity. She likes keeping her family well-fed with homecooked meals made from scratch. The smiles on everyone’s faces when they eat her delicious food make all the time my mom spends in the kitchen worthwhile. Her joy in cooking makes family gatherings feel extra warm and special.
