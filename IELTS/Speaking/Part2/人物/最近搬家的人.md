Here is an IELTS-style response:

I'd like to talk about my former university classmate John, who recently moved into a new live-work accommodation.

John and I were classmates while studying computer science at National University from 2010-2014. After graduating, John founded a technology startup company focused on remote sensing imaging. 

As his company grew, John decided to move into a new futuristic living space located inside a large software park. The open-layout apartment takes up an entire floor, with over 5,000 square feet of space. One side serves as John's living quarters, with a bedroom, kitchen, and lounge area. The other side contains a spacious office space, conference rooms, and workstations for employees. 

John opted for this unique live-work arrangement so he could fully immerse himself in running his startup. By having his home and office in one giant shared space, he can be available to his staff nearly 24/7. The communal layout also facilitates creativity, collaboration, and productivity. 

I believe this unusual move suits John's entrepreneurial lifestyle perfectly. Though unconventional, the enormous open concept home/office aligns seamlessly with his non-stop work ethic and desire to constantly interact with his team. The creative live-work space reflects John's innovative approach to business. This move was likely a positive step in growing his company and achieving his vision.
