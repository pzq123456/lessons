Here is an IELTS-style response describing my successful former classmate John:

I'd like to talk about my university classmate John, who I think has achieved great success in his career so far. John and I were both in the computer science program at National University from 2010 to 2014. We took many of the same courses and even participated in a software design competition together during our third year.  

John stood out for his exceptional programming abilities and strong research skills. While most students focused on coursework, John was actively involved in various research projects in the field of remote sensing and image processing. He just had a knack for coming up with innovative solutions to complex problems.

After graduating, John quickly published several well-received papers on remote sensing applications. His academic record helped him secure a research role at a leading technology company. Now, at just 30 years old, he is already viewed as an authority in his niche field. 

Most impressively, John is currently planning to start his own remote sensing imaging company. His combination of technical expertise and entrepreneurial drive make me confident he will succeed. Looking back, his early success was predictable given his talents even as a student. John's passion for remote sensing and willingness to work hard have clearly paid off.
