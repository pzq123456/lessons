## How do people bargain in China?
> Bargain with sb / Bargain  与某人讨价还价 / 讲价 单独使用

### simple answer

So, there are basically two ways in which Chinese buyers would like to bargain. The first way is sort of a go-to strategy. That is, the buyer might simply walk away right after they get the price and pretend that they are not so interested in the goods. After seeing this, the seller would eventually offer a more attractive price in order to lure the customer back. This works really well with most vendors in China. 
The second strategy is for the buyer to really negotiate the price with the seller a little bit. They might wanna provide some photos as evidence of the pricing of the same item in some other stores, such as online stores. This also might work out, especially when the buyer himself understands the situation really well.

## Do you think farming is important? 耕种

I think farming has been more important than ever before. The reason is that the world population has been on the rise ever since the turn of the 21st century. So, without enough supply of food from efficient ways of farming, we would have suffered from great hunger or even famine. However, it is because of modern, automated organic and conventional farming that we can feed so many people out there.
