## Part 1
### 1. Are robots important?
Yes, I definitely think robots are important, for a few key reasons. In the short term, they can take over dangerous jobs and tasks so that humans don't have to put themselves at risk. For example, robots can do things like defuse bombs, explore extreme environments, or handle toxic materials.

Looking more long term, robots have the potential to greatly advance technology and push forward human progress. As they get more advanced, robots may enable solutions to big problems like disease, poverty, and climate change. Their development could lead to huge leaps for the human species.

However, I do worry a bit about the risks if robots become too advanced and humans lose control. There need to be safeguards in place to prevent a scenario where the robots turn against people. But overall, I'm optimistic about the benefits robots can provide if we're careful to develop and use them responsibly.

### 2. Would robots affect people's lives?
Human-shaped robots that can move and act like people could become a regular part of everyday life. Since they look and function similar to humans, we may see them take on all kinds of roles - from helping around the house to working jobs. If advanced enough, humanoid robots could become almost like another species that's integrated into our society. I think they have huge potential to help with all kinds of tasks, though we'd have to set ground rules to make sure they remain under human control and aren't making important decisions for us. But overall, human-shaped robots blended into daily life seems very plausible down the road.

>   - And explain why it changed your life

This was when I was around 13 years old and still in middle school. My family decided to completely rebuild our house in the rural area where we lived. The old house had been built in the 1990s and was very outdated.

So one summer, we demolished the whole thing down to the foundation. We hired a construction company to draw up plans for a more modern, beautiful home. I remember going with my dad to check out the designs and give input on what I wanted in my new room.
It was a long process living in a tiny temporary steel structure on our property while the new house was built. But it was fascinating to see the progress day by day. I tried to watch whenever I could after school to see how the rooms and roof came together.
While it was tiring at times, overall it was an unforgettable experience being part of designing and building our family's new home from the ground up. I felt very invested in the whole process and proud when we finally moved into the finished house.
Being so involved in rebuilding our home at that young age really shaped who I am. It taught me practical skills like basic construction, following architectural plans, and working with contractors.
Living in the small temporary shelter and then moving into our spacious new house was an eye-opening contrast for me at a young age. It made me think about what really matters in life. My whole family was so proud when it was finished. Being part of that gave me more confidence in myself that has stuck with me since. The different experiences shaped who I am now.

## Part 3
### 1. Do you like new things or changes in life? 
Yes, I would say I like new things and changes in life overall. Going through the process of rebuilding our home as a teenager taught me to keep a positive attitude even when change is challenging.
Even though living in the temporary shelter was uncomfortable, I knew it was just a step toward the exciting end goal of our new house. So I've carried that mindset with me as I've taken on new chapters in life.
Change itself brings growth, even if it's difficult at first. My experience back then shaped my character and gave me confidence to take on new things. I learned that change is just part of the journey, and staying positive is key.
### 2. Why do some people quit and change jobs? 
Here's my take on why folks change jobs a lot of the time. Sometimes you end up in a gig that just doesn't fit who you are or what makes you excited, you know? The things you're good at or care about. So it makes total sense to find something new that's a better match if your passion fades.
Or maybe you feel stuck doing the same old grind day after day. You want some fresh challenges to grow but your job's not providing it. Changing careers can re-light that fire in you if you've lost motivation.
And hey, some people bounce around for practical reasons too - to make more money or get better perks, have a more flexible schedule, or move to a new place. It's not always a passion thing, but trying to improve their situation.
You made a good point too about flowing water staying fresher. Switching jobs keeps you moving forward in life when things go stale. I dig that analogy. We should keep evolving just like water flows, otherwise we get stagnant.
### 3. How to adapt to changes in life?
I'd say the key is to roll with the changes that come your way in life. Don't fight it, just expect that change is gonna happen and be ready for it. Keep doing what makes you passionate day to day. Be flexible and willing to modify your routines when stuff shifts. And take little steps to keep moving forward - motion creates more motion, you know? Even if life throws curveballs, adapt and adjust but don't lose momentum. 'Cause the world's always changing, so we've gotta change along with it. But as long as you protect that inner spark and keep taking baby steps ahead, you'll navigate any transition just fine. Make sense?
