### TASK 1
> vocabulary
> - `overall perspective` n. the general view of a particular situation
> - `farmland` n. land used for farming
> - `bisect` v. to divide something into two equal parts
> - `alteration` n. a change, usually a slight change, in the appearance, character, or structure of something
> - `residential` adj. used or designed for people to live in

The above maps detail Norbiton in the present day and plans for future development. `Looking from an overall perspective`, it is readily apparent that the town will become less industrial and more residential with the construction of facilities for housing, education, shopping, and medical care. This development will occur primarily to the west and north with only a small patch of farmland remaining undisturbed.

`In the current town`, there is a central roundabout surrounded by factories and a road running from west to east out of Norbiton. `In the future`, the roundabout will remain but the factories around it will become shops, new housing will line a northwestern road, and there will be a new hospital built to the southeast. The original road going to the east will also now have housing on either side along with a large playground to the north and a school at the easternmost border of the town.

`Outside the center of the town`, there are also plans for a smaller roundabout in the south which will bisect an existing street. In the north, there will be a bridge over the river and the farmland to the north will be partly replaced with housing, though not to the east where no alterations will be made.

### TASK 2
有些人认为，冒险对私人生活和职业生涯都是有利的。我基本上同意这种观点，因为它有助于个人的成长和发展。

Some would argue that taking risks, both in terms of one’s private life and one’s working career, is advantageous overall. I am generally in agreement with this **contention** due to the potential for advancement and growth.

首先，冒险可以加快实现个人职业目标。许多职员过早地满足于自己的当前职业而失去了实现个人潜力的机会。然而，另外一些人为了找到最适合自己的职位，不断在不同公司甚至是不同领域尝试。尽管这会带来短期挫折，但从长期来看，这些充满雄心壮志的人更有可能获得人生的成功。如果一个人在职业生涯的早期就甘冒风险，那么这个很大概率
Firstly, risk-taking can **expedite** one’s career goals. Many workers decide early on that they are content with their position in society and therefore often fail to **actualize** their potential. Others, however, attempt various business **enterprises** and transition from field to field in order to find a good match. Although this may lead to short-term **setbacks**, in the long-term such ambitious individuals are far more likely to become very successful in life. Assuming that these risks are taken early in one’s career, there is a strong likelihood that they will eventually profit the risk-taker in question.

Moreover, an individual who takes risks will also develop more mature personal relationships. In more conservative countries, many young people do not begin to have serious romantic relationships until after university. The result of this is that they are often immature and it can lead to poor and naive choices in terms of marriage and parenting. In contrast, a person who takes risks in their personal life and enters into various relationships throughout high school and university will become a better judge of character. Their allegedly risky behavior can then serve as the foundation for personal growth and increased maturity.

In conclusion, taking risks can be a catalyst for tremendous growth and is therefore advisable. The disadvantages of risk-taking can also be mitigated in most contexts by not being inordinately reckless.
