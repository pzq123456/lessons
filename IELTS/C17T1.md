## Reading

Between 1600 and 1900, literacy rates and book ownership were high and yet the region remained poor. It was also the case that local guilds and merchant associations were extremely powerful and legislated against anything that undermined their monopolies. In villages throughout the region, guilds blocked labor migration and resisted changes that might reduce their influence.

1600年至1900年间，识字率和图书拥有率都很高，但该地区仍然很贫穷。同样的情况是，地方行会和商业协会非常强大，并立法禁止任何破坏其垄断的行为。在整个地区的村庄，行会阻止劳动力迁移，并抵制可能减少其影响力的变革。

> - `overall perspective` n. the general view of a particular situation
> - `farmland` n. land used for farming

The above maps detail Norbiton in the present day and plans for future development. `Looking from an overall perspective`, it is readily apparent that the town will become less industrial and more residential with the construction of facilities for housing, education, shopping, and medical care. This development will occur primarily to the west and north with only a small patch of farmland remaining undisturbed.

上面的地图描述了Norbiton现在和未来发展的计划。从总体的角度来看，很明显，随着住房、教育、购物和医疗设施的建设，这个城镇将变得不那么工业化，而更多的是居民化。这种发展主要发生在西部和北部，只有一小片农田保持原样。

`In the current town`, there is a central roundabout surrounded by factories and a road running from west to east out of Norbiton. `In the future`, the roundabout will remain but the factories around it will become shops, new housing will line a northwestern road, and there will be a new hospital built to the southeast. The original road going to the east will also now have housing on either side along with a large playground to the north and a school at the easternmost border of the town.

在现在的城镇中，有一个中央环岛，周围是工厂和一条从西到东的道路。在未来，环岛将保留，但周围的工厂将变成商店，新的住房将沿着西北方向的道路排列，东南方向将建造一所新医院。原来通往东部的道路现在也将两侧都有住房，北部有一个大操场，东部边界有一所学校。

`Outside the center of the town`, there are also plans for a smaller roundabout in the south which will bisect an existing street. In the north, there will be a bridge over the river and the farmland to the north will be partly replaced with housing, though not to the east where no alterations will be made.

在城镇中心以外，还计划在南部建造一个较小的环岛，它将横穿一条现有的街道。在北部，将在河上建造一座桥，北部的农田将部分被住房取代，但在东部不会有任何改变。
### TASK 2

Some would argue that taking risks, both in terms of one’s private life and one’s working career, is advantageous overall. I am generally in agreement with this **contention** due to the potential for advancement and growth.

Firstly, risk-taking can **expedite** one’s career goals. 
  - Many workers 
    - decide early on that they are content with their position in society 
    - and therefore often fail to **actualize** their potential. 
  - Others, however, 
    - attempt various business **enterprises** 
    - and transition from field to field in order to find a good match. 
    - Although 
      - this may lead to short-term **setbacks**, 
      - in the long-term such ambitious individuals are far more likely to become very successful in life. 
Assuming that these risks are taken early in one’s career, there is a strong likelihood that they will eventually profit the risk-taker in question.

Moreover, an individual who takes risks will also develop more mature personal relationships.
  - In more conservative countries, many young people do not begin to have serious romantic relationships until after university. 
    - The result of this is that 
      - they are often immature 
      - and it can lead to poor and naive choices in terms of marriage and parenting. 
  - In contrast, a person 
    - who 
      - takes risks in their personal life 
      - and enters into various relationships throughout high school and university 
    - will become a better judge of character. 
  - Their allegedly risky behavior can then serve as the foundation for personal growth and increased maturity.

In conclusion, taking risks can be a catalyst for tremendous growth and is therefore advisable. The disadvantages of risk-taking can also be mitigated in most contexts by not being inordinately reckless.

### Exercise
有些人认为，无论是在私人生活还是在职业生涯中，冒险都是有利的。由于其促进进步和成长的潜力，我基本上同意这种观点。
Some would argue that taking risks, both in one's personal life and one's career life is advantageous overall. I am generally in agreement with this contention due to the potential for advancement and growth.
首先，冒险可以加快个人的职业目标。许多工人早早地就认定他们在社会上的地位，因此经常无法实现他们的潜力。然而，其他人则尝试各种商业企业，并从一个领域过渡到另一个领域，以找到一个好的匹配。虽然这可能导致短期的挫折，但从长远来看，这些雄心勃勃的人更有可能在生活中取得巨大的成功。假设这些风险是在一个人的职业生涯早期就被采取的，那么这个冒险者最终会从中获益。

此外，承担风险也有助于个人成长。在许多保守的社会中，年轻人往往不会在大学之前开始认真地谈恋爱。这样做的结果是，他们经常不成熟，这可能导致在婚姻和育儿方面做出错误和幼稚的选择。相比之下，一个在高中和大学期间冒险的人会成为一个更好的判断力量。他们所谓的冒险行为可以成为个人成长和成熟的基础。

总而言之，冒险可以成为巨大成长的催化剂，因此是值得提倡的。冒险的缺点在大多数情况下也可以通过不过度冒险来减轻。
