Some juveniles (children) spend a long time each day on their mobile phones. This is because `video-showing apps` are so engrossing (entertaining), but this can have negative consequences because they can distract children from family life.

Minors love using mobile devices because `streaming services` have many `entertaining videos`. This means they have endless opportunities to enjoy themselves, and they can spend their entire day consuming new shows without thinking. For example, many videos on Netflix are aimed at children, some of which design their title and thumbnails to entice children to click on one more video. **As a result**, they spend their free time in front of a screen instead of being outside doing physical activities, such as bike riding or playing sports.

**Despite** them being `highly enjoyable for` the child, this essay believes they should be viewed negatively because of the impact it has on home with parents and siblings. Because being around your family teaches you values, manners, and how to treat others.
