With the development of modern medicine and nutritional condition,  nowadays people have a longer livehood than ever before. From my point of view, a highly skilled aging population tends to be the powerful  treasure to a developed country because their stable living status, their wisdom and rich experience can be a concrete basement  maintaing the country's international power and domestic stability.

In todays world, you can see so many old men are active in the stage , espacially in the developed country's politic stage. Why is the old people? Let me take a example of the computer science. The IT indestry is kind of a intellenget intensive indeustry, and the word 'intellengent' has the same meaning of 'wisdom' which is the result of gradually advancing, step by step. There are so many old but powerfull and grant programmer active in today's IT industry and they are the king for thier technology framework. Their skill level is the mountain whcih deserves life-long pursuing process for the coming young people. 

In terms of the county condition, only the county which is highly industralised or very rich can find a way to compansate the lack of young labors and that is the extent. For deatails, a rich county will attrct aboundant labor forces and a highly tech-developed country can innovate new kind of labor like machine or AI. No matter what the detail is, the trend is that physical labor forces are becoming more and more useless and the intellengence or wisdom is going to be the key in the feture world. So, the population intellengence depends not the age.

All in all, I think technology can change the world and every can live as long as they like.
