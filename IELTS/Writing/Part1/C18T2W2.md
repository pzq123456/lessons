With the development of modern medicine and improved nutrition, people have a longer livespans than ever before. However, the aging population are now becoming a social problem to more and more countries. From my perspective, 

In todays world, you can see so many old men are active in the stage , espacially in the developed country's politic stage. Why is the old people? Let me take a example of the computer science. The IT indestry is kind of a intellenget intensive indeustry, and the word 'intellengent' has the same meaning of 'wisdom' which is the result of gradually advancing, step by step. There are so many old but powerfull and grant programmer active in today's IT industry and they are the king for thier technology framework. Their skill level is the mountain whcih deserves life-long pursuing process for the coming young people. 

In terms of the county condition, only the county which is highly industralised or very rich can find a way to compansate the lack of young labors and that is the extent. For deatails, a rich county will attrct aboundant labor forces and a highly tech-developed country can innovate new kind of labor like machine or AI. No matter what the detail is, the trend is that physical labor forces are becoming more and more useless and the intellengence or wisdom is going to be the key in the feture world. So, the population intellengence depends not the age.

Here is my assessment of your essay:

Overall, you have made a decent attempt at this essay topic. You present some reasonable arguments for why an aging population can provide benefits to a country. However, your essay would benefit from more development, organization, and examples.

The main positives are:

You provide a clear position that the advantages of an aging population outweigh the disadvantages.
You give some reasoning for why older people can provide stability and wisdom. The IT industry example offers a specific way older people contribute.
Your conclusion summarizes your viewpoint.
Some areas for improvement:

The essay lacks a clear overall structure. There is no introduction or conclusion paragraph.
The ideas could be better organized into paragraphs around central themes.
More examples and elaboration would strengthen the arguments. The IT industry example is a good start, but one example is not sufficient.
There are occasional grammar and word choice issues that need to be corrected. For example, "concrete basement" should be "solid foundation."
The final paragraph about technology and living longer does not seem directly relevant to the essay topic.
Overall, I would give this essay a 5 or 6 out of 9. You demonstrate some reasonable analysis of the topic, but need more supporting detail and better organization and language use to achieve a higher band score. I hope this helps provide some useful feedback to improve your IELTS writing skills. Please let me know if you have any other questions!

With the development of modern medicine and improved nutrition, people nowadays have longer lifespans than ever before. In my view, a highly skilled aging population can be a powerful asset to developed countries, as their financial stability, wisdom and rich experience provide a strong foundation for maintaining a country's international competitiveness and domestic harmony.

In today's world, many senior citizens play active roles in society, especially in the political spheres of developed nations. Why is this the case? Let us consider the example of the IT industry. As a knowledge-intensive sector, success in IT relies heavily on wisdom accrued over time through gradual learning and advancement. Numerous experienced programmers in their later years continue leading advancements in their technological domains. Their expertise represents the pinnacle of achievement that younger generations can aspire towards over their careers.

With regards to a country's needs, only highly industrialized or wealthy nations can find ways to compensate for dwindling youth demographics. For instance, prosperous countries can attract foreign workers, while those at the forefront of technology can innovate solutions such as automation and artificial intelligence. However, the overarching trend is that manual labor is declining in importance, while intelligence and wisdom will be the most valued skills in the future. Therefore, a population's ingenuity is not dependent on age.

In conclusion, technological progress may enable extended lifespans, allowing experienced seniors to continue contributing their knowledge and talents for the benefit of society. With the respect and inclusion of older generations, countries can build national strength and unity to thrive in the modern world.
