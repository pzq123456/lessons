"The annual income of households in the US in 2007, 2011, and 2015 is presented in the chart below."
"Displayed below is a chart showing the number of US households categorized by their annual income in 2007, 2011, and 2015." 
"This chart illustrates the distribution of US households across varying levels of annual income for the years 2007, 2011, and 2015."
"The chart depicts how US households were distributed across different annual income brackets in 2007, 2011, and 2015."
"Pictured below is the number of American households falling into each annual income group for the years 2007, 2011, and 2015."

The key changes:

- Moved "below" to the beginning to emphasize the chart placement 

- Used verbs like "presents", "illustrates", "depicts" instead of just "shows"

- Broke the information into pieces - chart, years shown, data illustrated

- Varied sentence structure (e.g. leading with year info versus chart info)

From a native English speaker's perspective, I would rate this opening sentence around a 6 out of 9 for an IELTS essay. Here's my analysis:

Pros:

- Clearly identifies the topic (US household incomes)

- Specifies the relevant years shown in the chart (2007, 2011, 2015) 

- Uses some appropriate vocabulary like "annual incomes" and "household conditions"

Cons: 

- The phrasing is a bit awkward and unclear in places 

- "Different annual incomes of the US people" is vague - better to say "distribution of household incomes" 

- "Their household conditions" is vague - be more specific about what conditions

- Passive voice "is illustrated" sounds unnatural - better to use active voice 

To score a 7 or above, I would recommend:

- Stating the main point upfront more clearly

- Using more precise, academic vocabulary

- Avoiding vague phrasing about "conditions" 

- Using active voice and varied sentence structure

- Adding context if relevant to the data trends

The chart depicts the number of US households categorized by their annual incomes in 2007,2011 and 2015.

From the bar chart, we can find that the peak of the household was about 34 percent per million in the year 2015 belonging to the group whose annual income is more than $100,000, and surprisingly the second highest income group had the lowest household which was about 14 percent in one million. The two groups whose incomes are both in the range from $50,000 to $99,999 share the same stability, yet others show wider variance in terms of household.

People who have less than $49,999 annual income share the same trend in households,  increasing and then declining after the highest point of about 30 percent per million.  However, people who have the highest annual income generate a totally reverse trend like the shape of "V" and the lowest point is in 2011 about 27 percent.

The bar chart depicts the number of US households in different income brackets in 2007, 2011 and 2015. Overall, the data shows that higher income households increased over this period, while lower and middle income groups remained relatively stable.

Specifically, households earning over $100,000 per year increased sharply from around 27% to 34% of the total, forming an inverted V shape with the lowest percentage in 2011. Meanwhile, those earning $50,000-99,999 fluctuated minimally between approximately 29-30%, making these income brackets the most consistent.

Households with under $25,000 and $25,000-49,999 followed similar upward then downward trends, both peaking at around 30% in 2011 before declining slightly. However, the under $25,000 group had greater variance across the years.

In summary, the chart illustrates widening income inequality, with growth only in the over $100,000 segment. The middle class remained steady while lower earners showed small fluctuations, suggesting stable but stretched finances for most Americans.
