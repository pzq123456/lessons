## 作文内容：
Some experts propose that the cost of fuels and all vehicles shoule be increased in order to solve the environmental problem. From my perspective, it depends on the real domestic and international condition for a specific country and the mehod metioned above can lead to both expected results and some side-effect.

Environmental problems always affect more than one countries and reagions as our environment has a sophisticated sphere structure in a large scale. Also, country is also a complicated and organic thing and has many sectors that affects each other. As a result, a single country's police about environment can have the chain effect both to its neighbours and itself. For example, increasing vehicle cost may open a door to the foreign auto-company which can manufacture more cheaper but low tech-standard cars and can make the emission even heavy. As to the fuel cost, if it is increaing, more and more people tends to embrace the electronic vehicles and some countries featuring traditional car industry may suffer from this.

However increasing the cost can be a good start. Words are week and political action is more useful.
